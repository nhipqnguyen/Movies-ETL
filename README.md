# Movies-ETL
# Project Overview
Our task is to help Amazing Prime, the world’s largest online retailer, use IMDB data to predict which low-budget movies will become popular. We’ll be using Python & Pandas to perform our data wrangling, and PostgreSQL to store our finished data.

## Challenge
- We create an automated pipeline that takes in new data (3 files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, MovieLens rating data), performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into tables in a PostgreSQL database.
- Below are screenshots of 2 queries that retrieve the number of rows for the 2 tables, 'movies' and 'ratings', and their outputs.
